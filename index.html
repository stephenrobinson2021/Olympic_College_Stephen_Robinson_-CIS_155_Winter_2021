<h2>Day Hiking</h2> 

<p>Its not uncommon to come across several species of wildlife along any of the numerous trails.  
Don't be surprised to walk around any bend in a trail and stumble upon a black bear or in rare occasions a mountain lion.  
If you're lucky enough you may even get a few pictures of the wildlife.</p>

<h2>Camping</h2> 

<p>Along most trails theres camping available.  Some sites have services such as a port-o-potty and lockers to keep your food secure from the animals. 
 Be sure to check your map and readthe information prived at the trailhead before your adventure.</p>
&nbsp;
 <p>The Hurricane Ridge Visitor Center is a great place to start. Located just before the end of the road, stop here for brochures, maps, snacks, and tips regarding your stay. It is open daily in the summer, and on Saturday/Sunday when the Hurricane Ridge Road is open during the remainder of the year.</p>
&nbsp;

 <p>Hurricane Ridge has a number of hiking trails, from ridgetop traverses to steep trails that descend to subalpine lakes and valleys. Obstruction Point Road (weather and snow permitting, open from July 4 through October 15), branches off right before the Hurricane Ridge Visitor Center, and provides access to a variety of trails as well.</p>
&nbsp;

 <p>During the winter months, snow enthusiasts enjoy the winter scenery, along with snowshoeing, cross-country skiing and sledding. Weather permitting, the Hurricane Ridge Winter Sports Club operates two rope tows and a Poma lift.</p>
&nbsp;

 <p>During the spring, wildflowers cover the ground of the subalpine meadows and blacktail deer are often spotted grazing. Sunrise and sunset on a clear day provide magnificent panoramic views of the park.</p>
